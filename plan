The manual dynamic libraries are ones where you explicitly load the library from your code, with calls such as dlopen (to open a library) and dlsym (to get the address of a symbol within that library).

init ---create thread---> threads ---------------- monitor
                            |
                          worker
                            |
                            +--A <--- load function
